Yes - I know you can say "Oh my gosh, what is it? Where is composer and prepared theme in one git-repo?"
Sorry. I haven't enough time to put all this in one theme.

That just approach from Alialaa. On past job we used his case: 
Theme with prepared common styles (text, links, buttons, footer, header), and options in custonmizer.
And plugin with gutenberg blocks (lik this https://github.com/Inglsmit/itineris-gutnberg-blocks/).
And other plugins for CPT, reg taxonomies. For example this useful for tests, we can switch off some plugins and test only one which we need.
